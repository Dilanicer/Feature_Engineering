# Feature_Engineering
#Feature engineering refers to the process of using domain knowledge to select and transform the most relevant variables from raw data when creating a predictive model using machine learning or statistical modeling. The goal of feature engineering and selection is to improve the performance of machine learning (ML) algorithms.
